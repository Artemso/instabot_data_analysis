A complementary data analysis project for my python Instagram bot

* WIP, but feel free to check it out!

## Built using:
* Bokeh – used for data visualisation
* Networkx – used to create a graph from obtained list of followers

This project gave me an interesting insight on connections between my friends and their relationships with each other.
